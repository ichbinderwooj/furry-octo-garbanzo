Hi there! If you are seeing this, then you probably saw my video on numerical solutions. I do have to admit that it is pretty bad.

So here are some notes about this code:
1. Yes I am using github don't attack me.
2. Don't worry about the name of the project.
2. To use the code, you will have to have installed ```matplotlib```. Doing that is simple! Just tell your cmd to ```py -m pip install matplotlib``` (well that's what I did)
4. Please don't tell me anyone can edit this.
